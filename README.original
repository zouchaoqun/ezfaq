=== ezFAQ plugin 0.3.5

This is a FAQ management plugin for Redmine.
ONLY compatible with Redmine last devel. NOT compatible with Redmine 0.8.x

=== Feature

1. Ask question and request a user to answer it.
2. FAQ is grouped by categories.
3. FAQ's modification has history logs.
4. Send notify email to the author and the assigned user who should answer the question.
5. FAQ creation or update is added to redmine's activity.
6. FAQ and FAQ-list can be exported to PDF document.
7. FAQ are searchable using redmine's search engine.

=== Note

Since the plugin applies a patch to redmine core, it can only run properly under
production environment. When runs under development envrionment, the faq with attachments
will fail to show.

Redmine currently doesn't support plugin to extend its search scope, so you have to
modify redmine's search controller to search FAQ.
(Edit ln51 in search_controller.rb, add faqs to the @object_types)

=== Plugin installation

1. Copy the plugin directory(ezfaq_plugin) into the vendor/plugins directory
   NOTE: The plugin directory must be ezfaq_plugin!

2. Migrate plugin:
   rake db:migrate_plugins

3. Start Redmine

Installed plugins are listed on 'Admin -> Plugins' screen.
